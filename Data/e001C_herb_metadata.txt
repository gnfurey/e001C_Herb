This readME describes the metadata of available files. These files are derived data sources from raw data files available on EDI for e001. The metadata has all been recorded with the data manager, but I am providing these details here as a backup.
#
data_e001herbivory_herb_meta.csv
Counts of white-tailed deer florivory
YEAR	Year
Month	Month of the year
exp	Cedar Creek Experimental Number
Field	e001 Field designation
Plot	Plot designation
NTrt	Nutrient Addition Treatment
NAdd	Nitrogen addition
Fenced	Fencing designation
Species	Species 8 letter e001 Species designation first four letters of genus and first four of species
Herb	Count of deer herbivory on inflorescences per species
Count	Count of inflorescences per species
#
data_e001herbivory_allNTrt.csv
Plant species abundance and aggregate variables
Year	Year
Plot	Plot designation
NAdd	Nitrogen addition
ln.NAtm.NAdd	The natural log of NAdd
NTrt	Nutrient Addition Treatment
sr	species richness: The total number of herbaceous species 	counted in each plot
TotBio	The sum of herbaceous species biomass excluding moss and 	lichens, misc. litter and all woody species 
Fenced	Fencing designation: 1 Fenced/0 Unfenced starts in 2005
FTrt	An additional fencing designation that goes to 1982. n.b. the 	fencing treatment does not start until 2005	
Field	e001 Field designation
exp	Cedar Creek Experimental Number
	The remaining variables are the species biomass with the first 	letters of their genus and the first four of their species 
The following derived datasets have the same format they only have the used nitrogen addition treatments
