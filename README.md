# e001C_herb

## Description

This project analyzes an experiment testing the combination of nitrogen addition and fencing in a grassland plant community. The experiment takes place within "Field C" in the experiment "e001: Long-Term Nitrogen Deposition: Population, Community, and Ecosystem Consequences". Further details are provided in the manuscript methods section.

## Reproducing results 

To reproduce the analyses, the scripts are labelled for each figure and table in order. 

1_e001Herbivory_Figure1_S1S2_final.R  
This file analyzes total plant biomass and produces the data for Figure 1, Table 1, Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2.   
1.1_e001Herbivory_Figure1_plot.R    
This file generates Figure 1.  
2_e001Herbivory_Figure2_final.R  
This file analyzes plant species richness and produces the data for Figure 2 and Table 1. It also generates Figure 2.   
3_e001_Herbivory_Table1.R  
This file generates Table 1   
4_e001Herbivory_Figure3_final.R  
This file analyzes the individual species' responses to fencing and nitrogen addition. It generates Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 3.  
5_e001Herbivory_florivory.R  
This file analyzes the counts of deer herbivory (florivory) on species' flowers.  
6_e001Herbivory_SupplementalFigureS1.R  
This file generates Supplemental Figure 1   
e001Herbivory_functions.R  
This file has a few generic functions.
